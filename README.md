# Gradient_Descent_Algo_implementation
Implementation of gradient descent algorithm from scratch using python for multiple variables

Implementation of Gradient Descent using python for minimizing a multiple variable function.
Letâ€™s take the polynomial function and treat it as Cost function and attempt to find a local minimum value for that function.

cost function: f(x,y)=x2+y2+1
